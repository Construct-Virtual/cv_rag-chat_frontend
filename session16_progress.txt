SESSION 16 PROGRESS
===================
Date: 2026-01-03

CRITICAL BUG FIXED
==================
Login Authentication Failure:
- **Issue**: Browser automation was failing to login even with correct credentials
- **Root Cause**: puppeteer fill() wasn't triggering React onChange events
- **Solution**: Use click() before fill() to properly trigger events
- **Impact**: Feature #1 verification now passes
